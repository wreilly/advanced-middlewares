Jesus H. Christ.
A Promise has a payload property.
A Promise has a status.
When that status is PENDING, the payload is EMPTY
When that status is RESOLVED, the payload has DATA.
Either way, there IS a payload property.

Our *IF* statement below is testing whether our action has any payload at all, empty or not.
It is testing whether we have a Promise,
whether this action is Async.

If it is not a Promise, we just return next(action)

/* JHC Update. Following comment is not the case. (sorry!) */
    // Promise means "PENDING" Promise.
    // NO DATA YET
    // *NOT* a "Resolved" "Promise" (Which *does* have the data, the payload)
    // We are filtering for PENDING PROMISES.
    // So: If no payload, or payload doesn't have .then property, send it on (next)

    // Note: that ".then" property is NOT seen on the browser console for the "action.payload" object.
    // I only saw it when explicitly calling for "action.payload.then" - it is "native code" - whatever deep magic that is.

/* Painful Explication of !Logic in IF():

1. LEFT-SIDE
Does your action have a .payload property?
(Most do). If it DOES, then LEFT-SIDE is FALSE.
So far, we are NOT going in to the nested logic in this IF statement, but hold on... ...

2. RIGHT-SIDE
Does your action.payload have .then property?
(Only payloads that are Promises do! Be that Pending or Resolved, I believe. Purty sure.)
A Payload that is instead the response result is no longer a Promise - it is now replaced with the DATA of the response! No ".then" property.
If we have a Promise, we do have a .then, and this is FALSE on the RIGHT-SIDE. Ergo, we are NOT going in to the nested logic. We SKIP past this IF check, on to the next code...
If we do NOT have a Promise, we have DATA, we do NOT have a .then, and this is TRUE on the RIGHT-SIDE.

3. CONCLUSION
As we know, if LEFT-SIDE is FALSE but RIGHT-SIDE is TRUE, here in this OR (||) statement, that is "Good Enough" and we ARE going in to the nested logic.
And, of course, if both are FALSE, we are NOT going in.
Cheers.
